# Exode 20
Exodus 20 is a text based game and my first Java game project to develop my Java programming skills.

## The Game's Story
A certain event will cause the end of life on Earth. Many people seek refuge in an underground bunker that can only accommodate a limited number of people. The player must accept or reject individuals based on their criteria and specificities. Only a few people can be accepted to ensure the survival of the human species.

The player must choose from 15 people with unique profiles. In addition to managing the bunker's resources, it is crucial to maintain good relationships between the characters. The interactions between the different individuals play an important role in the game. Furthermore, other survivors may appear at the bunker's door, but some could be infected by an epidemic.
